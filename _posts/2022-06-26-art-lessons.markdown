# Hello
{: #hello}

{% include collapser.markdown %}

<div>

At the time of writing, it's been a year since I've last posted. Increasingly I don't want my life out in the open and I don't want to interact in public online platforms.

I will leave the website and all the articles so far still up, but do not expect me to add more posts often.

I have decided to write publicly again because I have some useful information to pass on. These are lessons I've picked up on my art journey so far as I made artwork on my tablet. I do not have any artwork to show this time.

# Consistency Is More Important Than Accuracy
{: #consistency}

{% include collapser.markdown %}

<div>

A character can have completely wrong proportions and still look good because everything is consistent relative to everything else. Some art styles like chibi are very intentionally non-realistic, but that doesn't make it always look bad.

Do not over-rely on references. Definitely do not pose an anatomically accurate human model in Blender and draw over that.

Perhaps an artist will draw the outline for a hand that in some simple sense like point distance is very close to the "true" outline, but they receive feedback like this:

> The fingers are the wrong shape. They look like sausages. The middle finger is too long.

Finger outlines typically have a complex combination of straight segments, convex segments, and concave segments. Not getting that shape right can lead to it looking visibly wrong (like sausage fingers) even if the lines are all in the right place and therefore accurate.

The subject would likely look better if all the elements were off significantly in the same way and therefore similar and consistent with each other, rather than all off only a small amount but in different ways. In this example, one finger being unusually long is worse than all the fingers being long.

# Art Is Recognition, Not Generation
{: #recognition}

{% include collapser.markdown %}

<div>

Good art is not produced by following some algorithm.

From individual brush strokes to entire sections, artists will often take multiple attempts to make something until they are satisfied. This is why we have the undo button.

It's not because our hands are always shaking and it takes 10 tries to do a line well. We are experimenting, testing different possibilities, rejecting ones that do not look good, and settling once it looks good.

Art tutorials create the misconception that one can produce good art by following some algorithm. "Start with a circle, draw a line here, draw a line there, connect this part, and then you have a face."

It will look wrong. The recognition brain hardware is very advanced and will detect all kinds of errors. It is much smarter than any tutorial instructions could ever be.

Instead of trusting some instructions to produce perfection on the first try, one should experiment. Draw part of the face. Recognizer will say if it looks right. If it does not look right, go back and try something else. It could just be redoing a stroke expecting a minor change, or a bigger change.

I can distill one piece of knowledge I've acquired about drawing faces that generally look toward the camera:

> There should be a straight line from the chin point to the cheek, then a convex segment for the cheek, then (only if this is on the side away from the camera) a slight concave segment

I can confidently say all the good faces I've drawn follow this. Most anime-style art I see also has this characteristic.

It is not an algorithm. There is much information it is missing to be an algorithm, like how long each line should be and how much the curved segments should curve. Those aren't magic constants either, they depend on the face shape, camera angle, and of course, the artist's style.

Better to leave it to the recognizer. Try different variations and see what sticks.

Not having this characteristic leads to an error. Using a concave segment in place of the first line makes the chin too pointy. Curving the last concave segment too much makes it look like a large indentation has been punched into the face.

Which parameters lead to it actually looking right, I cannot know in advance, but I do know the version that looks good will have this characteristic, so I will never bother testing variations that don't have this characteristic.

Expert artists have better tuned their guessing skills (for lack of a better term) to get better quality in less tries, but they still don't have a magic method to get perfection on the first try.
