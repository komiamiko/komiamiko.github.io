![A forest, with some burning creature in it. The image is blurry, as if the photographer was moving quickly. The fire is yellow, then white, then purple, then black - the colours of the nonbinary flag. Fog covers the area.](/assets/flaming-gender/flaming-gender-monster.png)

Some time ago, I conceived this image, the flaming gender monster - a motion-blurred image of a burning strange creature in a forest, with the fire in nonbinary flag colours.
I had the day free today, so I made it happen.

Genre: Meme

This was made in Blender 2.91.
I used some assets from [HDRIHaven](https://hdrihaven.com/) and [TextureHaven](https://texturehaven.com/), which are published under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).
Trees are made with the [Modular tree](https://github.com/MaximeHerpin/modular_tree) addon, which you will need if you are editing the file.
I am publishing the Blender file along with all necessary assets.
Feel free to make whatever with it.

I have one artwork in planning, involving something I call "exotic materials."
One of these days I'll get around to making it.
More talk on what exactly an exotic material is and why they interest me will be published alongside the artwork.
That's all I want to announce for now.
